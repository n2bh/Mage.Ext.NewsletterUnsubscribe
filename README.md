# Newsletter Unsubscribe

## What does it do?

Extends Magento by a new Block to unsubscribe from the Newsletter - by default Magento allows Unsubscription only for logged in users, not for guests. 

Additionally, the module adds a frontend route to unsubscribe via dynamic link from within newsletters via shopdomain.tld/newsletter/unsubscribe/?email=alias@domain.tld
